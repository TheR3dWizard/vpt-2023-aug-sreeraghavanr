# STRATEGY:

   # Overall:
   1. We read the question and decided to use figma for the ui design and react for the front-end
   2. We split ourselves into 2 groups, figma and front-end code

   # React:

   1. We went through the next.js documentation and familiarised ourselves with the framework
   2. We started converting the figma designs into react components and simultaneously started working on the backend search functions

   # figma:
   1. 8:00 read the question and started group discussion
   2. 8:30 to 9:30 learned how to work with figma
   3. 9:30 started the actual work
   4. 9:45 decided on the colour palette and minimalistic approach
   5. 10:00 completed home page
   6. 11:00 completed advance search displays
   7. 1:00 completed the display when search is given
   8. 2:30: started to decide which information should be displayed
   9. 4:30 decided to use froms plugin insert instead of text boxes
   10. 7:00 finished work on all the displays needed
   11. the actual ui design https://www.figma.com/file/h5W8I7zYPISRnM4R5SD3W3/webtest?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ltI0aL9YPWCIMeaM-1
